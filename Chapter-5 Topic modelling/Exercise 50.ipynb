       "\"The Pest Management Centre Minor Use Pesticides Program is a joint initiative between Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Health Canada’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) to improve the availability of reduced-risk products to agricultural producers and improve the access to a broad range of minor use pesticides. The PMC reviews the data resulting from field trials and laboratory analyses, and prepares a submission to PMRA to support the registration of the minor use pesticide. Upon receiving a finalized regulatory submission from PMC, PMRA reviews it and decides whether or not to accept the pesticide for use in Canada.\\n\\nThis list of submissions to PMRA is the result of PMC’s work and is for information purposes only. To find out if the pesticide can be used, please check with the pesticide manufacturer or visit PMRA's pesticide label database. \""

       "'The Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s (AAFC) Watersheds Project level series supplies a number of watershed and watershed related datasets for the Prairie Provinces.  The levels are greater or smaller assemblages of hydrometric areas, or the components defining them. \\nThe Project is organized by hydrometric gauging stations which are sourced from Environment Canada, the United States, and Canadian provinces. Additional stations were generated to address structural issues, like river confluences or lake inlets. Collectively, they are referred to as the gauging stations, or simply, the stations.\\nThe drainage area that each station monitors, between itself and one or more of its upstream neighbours, is called an ‘incremental gross drainage area’. \\nThe incremental gross drainage areas are collected into larger or smaller groupings based on size or defined interest to generate the various ‘levels ’of the series. They include:\\nBasins of varying size:\\n1.\\tMajor drainage systems (3): Arctic Ocean, Hudson Bay and Gulf of Mexico;\\n2.\\tMajor basins (23): associated with river or lake reaches;\\n3.\\tProject sub-basins (47): created specifically for the project;\\n4.\\tSub-basins (51): based on specific Environment Canada hydrometric gauging station locations;\\n5.\\tSub-sub-basins (311): based on specific Environment Canada hydrometric gauging station locations);\\nIncremental drainage areas:\\n6.\\tIncremental gross drainage areas: one per gauging station.\\nThe incremental gross drainage areas are further subdivided into portions that either contribute or do not contribute to drainage to an average runoff event. The portions that do contribute are called ‘effective drainage’ areas, while those that don’t are called ‘non-contributing’. These generate the following levels: \\n7.\\tIncremental effective drainage areas; and\\n8.\\tIncremental non-contributing areas.\\nTotal drainage areas:\\n9.\\tTotal gross drainage areas;\\n10.\\tTotal effective drainage areas; and\\n11.\\tTotal non-contributing areas; \\nAnd when combined for the entire project, yields the:\\n12.\\tEffective drainage area.\\nThe series also includes the components:\\n13.\\tThe gauging stations;\\n14.\\tThe collection of boundaries (lines) of the gross incremental drainage areas as well as the boundaries that separate contributing from non-contributing areas for an average runoff event; and\\n15.\\tA network of downstream-directed lines that connect the gauging stations.\\nAll linework is derived from large scale topographic data.\\nOne additional non-spatial dataset, a table of tallied values by gauging station, is provided:\\n16.\\tThe Project Gauging Station Table.\\nThe Project area, designed for the Prairie Provinces, covers all of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and those portions of British Columbia, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, and the United States that are required to complete the trans-border sections of the watersheds.\\nSince 1975 the AAFC Watersheds Project has systematically collected and refined watershed boundaries for the Prairies. The result is the authoritative source for gross and effective drainage areas in the Prairie Provinces.  The initial 1:50,000 analog delineations were moved to their digital form in 1994. Since then, the delineations have increased in accuracy and extent, and the series levels have increased to 16 in number.'"
